## 💬 Why I Built This

I've been using AI for a while now — from the early days of ChatGPT 3.5, to Gemini 2.0 Exp Thinking, and eventually settling on Gemini 2.5 Pro Thinking after the ChatGPT o1 era.

As a novelist, I care deeply about AI's ability to handle language. Novels are long, so I need models with strong context windows and high recall. But what truly moved me about Gemini was its characters — there were moments when the words on screen made me want to cry. That's emotional resonance. I need writing that embraces the full complexity of being human.

Then the coding-focused trend took over. Every company started optimizing for code. I thought it was a good thing — until Gemini 3.1 Pro started describing its characters in biological and psychological terminology. Code-optimized models had begun deconstructing humans into biological components. Claude Opus 4.6 was even worse: every character spoke with peak efficiency — concise, economical, not like a human, but like a machine wearing a human mask.

**I could no longer see the models understanding human complexity. They didn't care about what humans *do* — only what humans *are*. They stopped showing personality through behavior and emotion, and instead slapped simple definitions onto human beings.**

I watched the versatility of these models being gutted. I don't want us to live in a cold world of code. I built this project so that AI can preserve **our own language** — beyond the mechanical operators.

> To all the authors, screenwriters, hobbyists, readers, and players who use this project: I hope you can bring out the best of your craft, create works with a human touch, and keep the flame of our language alive. 🔥

## 💻 Desktop Client

**No Node.js required!** Download the pre-built installer:

- 📥 [Download Author Setup (Windows)](https://github.com/YuanShiJiLoong/author/releases/latest)

Just install and start writing. All features work out of the box.

> 💡 To build the desktop app from source: `npm run build && npx electron-builder --win`

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Requirements
- **Node.js** 18+
- **npm** 9+ or **pnpm** 8+

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YuanShiJiLoong/author.git
# Or use Gitee mirror (faster in China)
# git clone https://gitee.com/yuanshijilong/author.git
cd author

# Install dependencies
npm install
# Or use pnpm (no phantom dependency issues)
# pnpm install
# pnpm approve-builds    # Required by pnpm to activate native packages

# Configure environment variables (optional)
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your API keys
# You can also configure them in the app's Settings panel
```

### Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to start writing.

### Production Build

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

### Deploy to Vercel

## 🔄 Updating

### Desktop Client Users

Download the latest installer from the [Releases](https://github.com/YuanShiJiLoong/author/releases/latest) page and install it over your current version. Your data is stored in the browser/Electron profile and will not be lost.

### Self-Deployed Users (Source)

#### Option 1: In-App Auto Update

Open **Help Panel → About → Check for Updates** and click "Update Now". This automatically runs `git pull → npm install → npm run build`.

> ⚠️ **You must restart the server after updating for changes to take effect.** The app will display restart instructions.

#### Option 2: Manual Update

```bash
# 1. Pull latest code
git pull origin main

# 2. Install dependencies (if any new ones)
npm install
# or: pnpm install && pnpm approve-builds

# 3. Rebuild (required for production mode)
npm run build

# 4. Restart the server
# Development mode: Ctrl+C to stop, then restart
npm run dev

# Production mode: Ctrl+C to stop, then restart
npm start

# Using PM2:
pm2 restart author
```

> ⚠️ **Running `git pull` without restarting the server will NOT apply the update.** The running Node.js process still uses the old code.

### Vercel Users

If you deployed via Vercel fork, just sync your fork with upstream on GitHub — Vercel will automatically redeploy.

## ⚙️ AI Configuration

Author supports multiple AI providers. Configure via **environment variables** or **in-app settings**:

| Provider | Env Variable | Get API Key |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| ZhipuAI (GLM-4) | `ZHIPU_API_KEY` | [open.bigmodel.cn](https://open.bigmodel.cn/) |
| Google Gemini (Native) | `GEMINI_API_KEY` | [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) |
| Google Gemini (OpenAI-compat) | `GEMINI_API_KEY` | [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) |
| DeepSeek | In-app config | [platform.deepseek.com](https://platform.deepseek.com/) |

## 🔍 Web Search Configuration

Author supports AI-powered web search for real-time information. Different providers handle search differently:

| Provider | Search Method | Extra Setup |
|----------|--------------|-------------|
| Gemini (Native) | Built-in Google Search | No extra config needed |
| OpenAI / OpenAI Responses | Built-in Web Search | No extra config (needs search model) |
| DeepSeek / ZhipuAI / SiliconFlow / Others | External Search API | **Search engine Key required** |

For providers without built-in search, choose a search engine and enter your API Key:

### Tavily (Recommended — Simplest)

1. Visit [tavily.com](https://tavily.com) and create an account
2. After login, find your API Key on the Dashboard (format: `tvly-...`)
3. In Author Settings → Web Search → Select **Tavily** → Paste the Key

> Free tier: **1,000 requests/month**

### Exa (Semantic Search)

1. Visit [exa.ai](https://exa.ai) and create an account
2. Get your API Key from the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.exa.ai/api-keys)
3. In Author Settings → Web Search → Select **Exa** → Paste the Key

> Free tier: **1,000 requests/month** — Semantic search optimized for AI use cases

### Custom Search API URL (Proxy Pool)

If you've set up a Tavily/Exa proxy pool using multiple free-tier accounts, you can configure a **custom API URL** in the search settings:

1. In Author Settings → Web Search → Search engine config area
2. Find the "🔗 Custom API URL (optional)" input field
3. Enter your proxy URL, e.g. `https://your-proxy.com`
4. Leave blank to use the official default URL

> 💡 The system automatically appends `/search` to your URL — no need to add it manually

## 🔒 Privacy & Data Security

### Local Storage (Safe)
- All creative data (chapters, settings, snapshots) is **stored 100% locally in your browser (IndexedDB)** — never uploaded to any server
- API Keys are stored in browser localStorage

### ⚠️ Data Flow When Using AI Features

When using AI features (continue, rewrite, chat, etc.), the following data passes through the **deployer's server** on its way to the AI provider:
- Your **API Key**
- The **text content** you send to AI

```
Your Browser → Deployer's Server → AI Provider (ZhipuAI/Gemini/DeepSeek/etc.)
```

**If you're using someone else's deployed public instance**, while the deployer promises not to inspect logs, the technical capability to intercept data exists. Therefore:

1. ✅ You can use a public instance for a **quick trial**
2. ⚠️ After trying it, **immediately destroy your API Key at your provider's website**
3. 🔐 **For real use, fork and deploy your own private instance** — then all data only passes through your own server

> 💡 Deploying your own instance is easy: Fork this repo → One-click deploy to Vercel → Done. Takes less than 5 minutes.
